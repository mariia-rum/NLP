# NLP Summarization Algorithms

## Overview
This repository explores and tests various NLP summarization algorithms. The primary goal is to summarize textual data efficiently using both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using WordCloud visualizations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- **WordCloud Visualization**: A visual representation of the top 100 most popular words and phrases is created based on their frequency and relevance. This provides a simple yet effective EDA approach to understand the dataset's content.

## Preprocessing Steps
Preprocessing plays a crucial role in building NLP models. In this repository, preprocessing is implemented through a pipeline to ensure efficiency and consistency. The key preprocessing steps include:
- Lowercasing the text
- Removing punctuation
- Removing stopwords
- Tokenizing the text
- Applying stemming and lemmatization

## Summarization Techniques
Two main text summarization methods are implemented:

### 1. **Extractive Summarization**
- **Concept**: Extractive summarization identifies and extracts the most important sentences or phrases directly from the original text to create a summary.
- **Objective**: Select key sentences based on their importance to represent the main ideas of the text.

### 2. **Abstractive Summarization**
- **Concept**: Abstractive summarization generates a new summary by rephrasing and restructuring sentences. This method relies on deep learning models to understand and rewrite the content.
- **Process**: The encoder outputs masked tokens, and the decoder generates gap sentences to form a coherent summary.
- **Models Used**:
  - **BERT**: A transformer-based model developed by Google, optimized for understanding context in sentences.
  - **XLNet**: Another transformer model by Google, designed to improve upon the limitations of BERT by using a permutation-based training objective.

## Summary
This repository demonstrates the implementation of text summarization algorithms using advanced preprocessing and state-of-the-art NLP models. It provides insights into both extractive and abstractive approaches to text summarization, leveraging tools like WordCloud for data visualization and models like BERT and XLNet for summarization tasks.
